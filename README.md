# transit-isochrones

Extension of [Mapbox Isochrone API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/isochrone/) to public transit.

## What you need to get started

A free tier Mapbox account. Up to 100,000 API hits per month are allowed on the free tier. In the mapbox.env file in the base directory, place your public key. Reminder - do not publish your public key to GitHub directly, unless you want to pay for someone elses API hits.
The GTFS files of a public transit provider of reference. Place these in /data/gtfs/{service-provider-name}. If you are looking for historical GTFS files, here are a few options:
- [Mobility Database](https://mobilitydatabase.org/)
- [Transit Land](https://www.transit.land/)
